Initial programming was undertaken on behalf of the "Stiftung Deutsche
Geisteswissenschaftliche Institute im Ausland" (Foundation German
Humanities Institutes Abroad) for the publication platform
http://www.perspectivia.net.

Funding was provided by the German "Bundesministerium für Bildung und
Forschung" (Federal Ministry of Education and Research).

The programming was coordinated by the ``Fafalter GmbH``, Düsseldorf,
Germany, namely Ruth and Bories von dem Bussche.

Many thanks to all these institutions and persons!
