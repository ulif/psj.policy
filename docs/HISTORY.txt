Changelog
*********

0.3 (unreleased)
================

Feature changes
---------------

* Added transform to scrub OO.org generated HTML. ``ooo_html_body``
  transform delivers the body of an OO.org generated HTML document
  including also style settings set in header.

* Removed ``oooctl``, ``convert`` scripts. They are now maintained in
  a separate package `ulif.openoffice` (which needs to be
  installed). This is more reliable in that a locally installed
  OpenOffice.org suite (as provided by dists like Ubuntu) can be used.

  We now also have a distinct interface to communicate with an
  OpenOffice.org server.

* Changed OpenOffice.org transforms to use new ulif.openoffice
  package for document conversion.

* Added .docx transformations. We can now also convert .docx files to
  .pdf and HTML.

* Added conditional registering of mime-type for .docx files and icon.

==================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix broken download URL for OpenOffice.org in buildout.

0.2 (2008-12-09)
================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed race condition or whatever, that stopped the conversion from
  working with ``Products.LinguaPlone`` package.

* Enabled XHTML-1.0 output instead of HTML.

* Improved transform initialization to cope with already installed
  transforms of same names. Those are now unregistered first.
